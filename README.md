### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm a self taught Python developer and I also create projects like these:

# OakPi - Raspberry Pi 4 4Gb Laptop
Handmade out of 2 pieces of Oak timber and why not? Although it's not a monster powerful machine to use but it is perfectly fine for coding, excellent for use of the GPIO's and good enough to screen capture whilst coding with webcam use and stream live to my YouTube channel and more information can be found via

# Home Heating and Security Control
This controls my heating via a temperature sensor and a relay to control my central heating instead of my old thermostat. It also controls my security lights via relays and takes input via external PIR sensors. There are some additional features and more information can be found via
